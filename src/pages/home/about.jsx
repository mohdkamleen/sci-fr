            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This project has been done by team "WHITE EAGLE." We have 4 members in our team named Wakil Ahmad (Team Leader), Mohd Wazeh, Abusad Ahmad and Mohd Kamleen. We are undergraduate student of B.Tech (CSE) in 3rd year. <br /><br />
               
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The problem of the parking system is a difficult task to manage when there is a large number of vehicles in public areas and the vehicle owner did not get to know if a spot is available or not and where it is located. After parking somehow, somtimes they forgot the exact location where they have parked thier vehicle.
                We have eliminated this problem of parking through this project in which a customer could see the real time slot status of parking area. The customer will be able to know that whether the parking slot is vacant or occupied. The vehicle owner could only park if the parking slot is available. The vehicle owner will also be able to track their bill of parking.
                Our team have used several technologies to complete this problem such as Python fo UI and API, Firebase for Database. <br /><br />
